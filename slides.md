# What's GitHub???

~

--

~ GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

--
```
> repository
```

--
```
> branches
```

--
```
> commits
```

--
```
> Pull / Pull requests
```

# 1. Create a Repository

~
--
- Repository -> used to organize a single project
--
- Folders/Files/Images/Videos/Data sets etc...
--
- README / license file 

> Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ anything your project needs.
> Write some crazy code, break something.
> It will also maybe even teach you something about programming
> and allow you to reason about code in a different way.
